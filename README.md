### Redux
the Redux architecture centers around a strict unidirectional data flow. All data within the application flow in one direction through components. At a high level, Redux aims to ensure deterministic view renders as well as deterministic state transformation and reproduction. Determinism here refers to the ability to know that at any given point in time, your application state is always valid and can be transformed into another predictable and valid state. Your UI components then update based on the given state.
