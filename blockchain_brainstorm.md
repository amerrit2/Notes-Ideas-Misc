- Super PAC Distributed Lobbying
    - Provide lobbying money behind *specific* political stances/opinions
    - Super PACs attempt to solve this by creating coalitions of people/organizations that can have high donation limits and can spread support strategically behind candidates
        - There's still an issue with centralized decision making.  The Super PAC is vulnerable to manipulation/collusion
    
- Distributed solution involves 'Political Position Contracts' 
    - payout for a position-contract is handled by voting of stakeholders to the contract on races/candidates that align with the position
    - Periodic 'reputation' scores for candidates would be global to the system and affect payouts
    - One or many Super PACs would be established that solely transfer contract payouts into political donations for compliance reaons
        - This way donation is only performed through the Super PAC so candidates / political organizations don't have to deal with blockachain contracts
